With the new HTML5 features, modify the form so that:

The formula input field has an autocomplete option with the following options: "sin", "cos", "tan" and "cot".
The iterations input field is a slider with possible values from 1 to 10.
The precision input field is a number picker with possible values from 1 to 100, where 50 is the default value.
