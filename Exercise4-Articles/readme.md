Using CSS only (without adding additional HTML attributes), style articles so that they occupy the whole browser window and have the following properties:

| Article       | Position            | Background color  |
| ------------- |:-------------------:| -----------------:|
| First         | Upper-left quarter  | Red               |
| Second        | Upper-right quarter | Yellow            |
| Third         | Lower-left quarter  | Blue              |
| Fourth        | Lower-right quarter | Green             |
